###Highly comparative time-series analysis code repository

This repository draws on the work published as:

B. D. Fulcher, M. A. Little, N. S. Jones (2013) [Highly comparative time-series analysis: the empirical structure of time series and their methods](http://rsif.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/10/83/20130048.full). J. Roy. Soc. Interface. 10, 83.

As part of this work, hundreds of pieces of time-series analysis code were developed that produce thousands of features summarizing structural properties of time series.
An accompanying web resource for this project is [comp-engine time series](www.comp-engine.org/timeseries), which allows users to compare (and more recently upload) thousands of diverse types of time-series analysis code and time-series data.
This code repository is a more in-depth accompaniment to this work, that helps the user set up a mySQL database through Matlab and perform highly comparative time-series analysis on custom datasets using the latest set of code and input settings.

To use the repository, please make a private fork of it, clone it to your local machine, and then set an [upstream remote](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/#step-3-configure-git-to-sync-your-fork-with-the-original-spoon-knife-repository) to keep it synchronized with the main repository e.g., using the following code:
```
git remote add upstream https://github.com/SystemsAndSignalsGroup/hctsa.git
````
You can then update to the latest stable version of the repository by pulling the master branch to your local repository:
```
git pull upstream master
```

Any feedback is hugely helpful ([email me](mailto:ben.d.fulcher@gmail.com)) and, in particular, any improvements to the code would be _much_ appreciated in the form of [issues](https://github.com/SystemsAndSignalsGroup/hctsa/issues) or [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).
