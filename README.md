# :wavy_dash: *hctsa* :wavy_dash:: highly comparative time-series analysis

*hctsa* is a software package for running highly comparative time-series analysis using [Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/) (full support for versions R2018b or later).

The software provides a code framework that enables the extraction of thousands of time-series features from a time series (or a time-series dataset).
It also provides a range of tools for visualizing and analyzing the resulting time-series feature matrix, including:
1. Normalizing and clustering the data,
2. Producing low-dimensional representations of the data,
3. Identifying and interpreting discriminating features between different classes of time series,
4. Learning multivariate classification models.

**Feel free to [email me](mailto:ben.d.fulcher@gmail.com) for help with real-world applications of _hctsa_** :nerd_face:

## Getting Started :blush:

### Documentation &#x1F4D6;
__Comprehensive documentation__ for *hctsa*, from getting started through to more advanced analyses is on [gitbook](https://hctsa-users.gitbook.io/hctsa-manual).

### Downloading the repository :arrow_down:

For users unfamiliar with git, the current version of the repository can be downloaded by simply clicking the green _Clone or download_ button, and then clicking _Download .zip_.

It is recommended to use the repository with git.
For this, please [make a fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) of it, clone it to your local machine, and then set an [upstream remote](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/#step-3-configure-git-to-sync-your-fork-with-the-original-spoon-knife-repository) to keep it synchronized with the main repository e.g., using the following code:
```
git remote add upstream git://github.com/benfulcher/hctsa.git
```
(make sure that you have [generated an ssh key](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/) and associated it with your Github account).

You can then update to the latest stable version of the repository by pulling the master branch to your local repository:
```
git pull upstream master
```

For analyzing specific datasets, we recommend working outside of the repository so that incremental updates can be pulled from the upstream repository.
Details on how to merge the latest version of the repository with the local changes in your fork can be found [here](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/).

[_CompEngine_](http://www.comp-engine.org) is an accompanying web resource for this project.
It is a self-organizing database of time-series data that allows users to upload, explore, and compare thousands of diverse types of time-series data.
This vast and growing collection of time-series data can also be downloaded.
You can read more about it in our [&#x1F4D9;preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.01042).

Is over 7000 just a few too many features for your application?
Do you not have access to a Matlab license?
_catch22_ has all of your faux-rhetorical questions covered.
This reduced set of 22 features, determined through a combination of classification performance and mutual redundancy as explained in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.10200v2), is available [here](https://github.com/chlubba/catch22) as an efficiently coded C implementation with wrappers for python and R.
